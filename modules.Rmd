This is, first and foremost, a **Health Economics** class, so health economics content takes priority. Still, it's impossible to study this area without a solid understanding of common research designs and econometric estimators. Good applied microeconomics research also increasingly calls for transparent and reproducible code.

This class is organized so as to (hopefully) weave best practices for implementing common research designs into a few core supply-side health economics topics. We do this by introducing a new research design with each core module, and in all cases, we're expected to work in a transparent and reproducible way so that we can begin to establish solid research habits.

The course consists of four modules (plus an introduction), listed below. I'll start off each module with a brief presentation Follow the link for more detail about each module:
