# Overview 
This is the guide for **Module 0**, which is really just an introduction to the class. To that end, the first thing you should do for the class is read the [syllabus](../syllabus/syllabus-771.pdf).

# Goals
Hopefully this is evident from the syllabus and the landing page for the class, but my overarching goals for this class are to learn about supply-side health economics, employ some standard econometric estimators and identification strategies specifically in the context of health economics, and get some practice working with real data in a real world environment. 

This last goal (real data in a real world environment) is worth a bit more explanation. Just looking at the assignments, it might be intimidating.

But these things are planned very specifically in order to get you some experience working with real data, employing current methods with those data, and examining a relevant question in the area of health care economics. While we are definitely going to use lots of different datasets for this class, I will always provide some code to help work with the data (more or less depending on how challenging the data management is). More importantly, I'm **always** available to you for help or discussion. Ultimately, I want this class to help get you where **you** want to be, not to mold you into some version of a health economist that I have in my mind. But the only way I can help you is if I know where you want to go. So we have to work together!

Ok - now we're getting into some economics. For this, I'll move over to our [Introduction Slides](slides-class1.html).
