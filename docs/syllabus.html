<div id="course-description" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>This course explores the industrial organization of healthcare
markets in the U.S. We will focus on the following areas: hospital
ownership and production, physician agency, information disclosure, and
hospital competition. If we have time, we will briefly cover some issues
on health insurance markets. The class is effectively designed as a
combination of empirical IO and causal inference, with applications to
healthcare. As such, we will also examine several econometric tools and
causal inference identification strategies. These methods will be
introduced as needed throughout the course.</p>
<p>Supply-side health economics is a rapidly growing field with many new
developments, particularly in the areas of bargaining in two-sided
markets and physician learning. Some of these recent developments use
tools from network analysis and machine learning, which we unfortunately
do not have time to cover in this course. I’ve also chosen specific
topics that overlap most with my own research — the upside here is that
I can speak somewhat confidently about the literature and empirical
studies in this area, but the downside is that some very interesting
areas of health economics are not studied. For example, we will largely
ignore issues of the prescription drug market, medical devices, and
physician labor supply. My hope is that the content that we do cover
will provide a springboard for those interested in these other important
areas.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-outcomes" class="section level1">
<h1>Learning Outcomes</h1>
<p>I have five central goals for this course:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Synthesize the current literature in each of the main areas of
health economics covered in this class</p></li>
<li><p>Apply standard causal inference techniques in the area of
healthcare</p></li>
<li><p>Provide constructive criticism of academic work in this
area</p></li>
<li><p>Organize real-world data with current workflow and versioning
tools</p></li>
<li><p>Develop your own preliminary research in some area of health
economics</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are more specific learning outcomes for each module described
on the relevant module’s page of our class website, accessible <a
href="https://imccart.github.io/Econ-771/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="text-software-and-class-materials" class="section level1">
<h1>Text, Software, and Class Materials</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Readings:</strong> As an elective PhD course, we will
rely on academic papers from the reading list below. I expect everyone
to read the papers in advance and come to class with questions on the
study’s contribution, empirical techniques, identification strategies,
and datasets used. My goal with each paper is to discuss the analysis in
detail. As such, the primary reading list is perhaps shorter than a
standard PhD course. I’ve provided supplemental reading in each section
for those interested in additional readings in a specific area.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software:</strong> For almost everything in this class,
I’ll use <code>R</code>, but you are free to use whatever software
you’re most comfortable with. I encourage you to use <code>R</code>,
<code>Stata</code>, or <code>Python</code> simply because these are the
most common programs used in practice right now. You’ll also need to
have a basic working knowledge of Git and GitHub. If you’re new to these
tools, take a look at <a href="https://grantmcdermott.com/">Grant
McDermott’s</a> notes on <a
href="https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures">Data Science for
Economists</a> as well as <a href="https://jennybryan.org/">Jenny
Bryan’s</a> online reference book, <a
href="https://happygitwithr.com/">Happy Git and GitHub with
R</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accessing Data:</strong> For any in-class activities, I
will house all of the code and links to the data on our class website.
For any real-life datasets, I will also point you to other GitHub
repositories where available, and I’ll make some data available via
OneDrive. Details will be posted on Canvas and in class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logistics:</strong> For day-to-day communication, grades,
and other private information (such as Zoom meeting links if needed),
I’ll use <em>Canvas</em>. I’ll post all other materials to our class
website.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Slides and Notes:</strong> Any presentations will be made
available on our class website prior to any given class.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="course-policies" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Policies</h1>
<p>Various policies for this course are described below. Basically,
let’s all work to be good citizens and take seriously our various roles
as a student, teacher, friend, colleague, human, etc.</p>
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic integrity</h2>
<p>The Emory University Honor Code is taken seriously and governs all
work in this course. Details about the Honor Code are available in the
Laney Graduate School Handbook and available online <a
href="https://www.gs.emory.edu/academics/policies-progress/conduct.html">here</a>.
By taking this course, you affirm that it is a violation of the code to
plagiarize, to deviate from the instructions about collaboration on work
that is submitted for grades, to give false information to a faculty
member, and to undertake any other form of academic misconduct. You also
affirm that if you witness others violating the code you have a duty to
report them to the honor council.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility-services" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessibility services</h2>
<p>If you anticipate issues related to the format or requirements of
this course, please meet with me. I would like us to discuss ways to
ensure your full participation in the course. If you determine that
accommodations are necessary, you may register with Accessibility
Services at (404)727-9877 or via e-mail at <a
href="mailto:accessibility@emory.edu"
class="email">accessibility@emory.edu</a>. To register with OAS,
students must self identify and initiate contact with the OAS
office.</p>
</div>
<div id="communication" class="section level2">
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>I will post regular announcements to the class on <em>Canvas</em>, so
please set up your notifications on <em>Canvas</em> accordingly. I will
also use <em>Canvas</em> to post all grades and any other information
that needs to stay in the class (like our <em>Zoom</em> meeting link for
virtual meetings, if needed). All other course materials will be
available on our class website, <a
href="https://econ771f22.classes.ianmccarthyecon.com/">econ771f22.classes.ianmccarthyecon.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Please feel free to reach out to me for any reason. I generally
respond to all e-mails within 24 hours.</p>
</div>
<div id="office-hours" class="section level2">
<h2>Office Hours</h2>
<p>My office is in room 573 of the PAIS building. This is where I’ll be
for official office hours; however, I’m happy to meet outside of normal
office hours as well. Please feel free to schedule another time to meet
by following the link to select a time that works for you, <a
href="https://mccarthy-meetings.youcanbook.me">https://mccarthy-meetings.youcanbook.me</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="attendance" class="section level2">
<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>While there is no official “attendance” credit, everyone is expect to
attend all class sessions. Given our small class, it is very important
that we are all present and engaged.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="assignments-and-grading" class="section level1">
<h1>Assignments and Grading</h1>
<p>There are four main assignments throughout the semester, along with a
participation component. I describe each assignment below, with more
detail provided on our <a
href="https://imccart.github.io/Econ-771/">class website</a>. Note that
I <strong>do not</strong> expect or want anyone to treat these
assignments as entirely separate. By that, I mean you should try to
identify datasets from the exercises that you can use in your
replication project, and you should try to select papers to present that
use those data. At a minimum, you should present the paper that you will
be replicating. With a little bit of up-front planning, you can create a
lot of overlap across assignments, which will make your life much
easier.</p>
<div id="participation" class="section level2">
<h2>Participation</h2>
<p>Everyone will benefit much more from the class if we are all actively
engaged. As a small incentive to stay engaged, I’ll keep track of those
who participate in our discussion each day. Any amount of participation
(questions or comments) will be worth one point for that class. I’ll
tally everyone’s participation points at the end of the semester.</p>
</div>
<div id="empirical-exercises" class="section level2">
<h2>Empirical exercises</h2>
<p>Each course module will have an applied component where we spend some
time replicating analyses from selected papers based on real-world data.
These will require some of your time outside of class to get the data in
working order and implement the relevant identification strategy and
econometric estimator. This empirical work should heavily complement
your draft paper. The due dates for all empirical exercises are
indicated in the schedule below. In general, we have one empirical
assignment due at the end of each module.</p>
<p>For each assignment, your final product should consist of a
discussion of the data sources, steps taken to clean the data and
replicate the final analytic sample, a summary of your model and
estimator, and your results. You must turn in your assignment on
<em>GitHub</em>, including your code files (Stata, R, Python, SAS,
etc.), all figures/tables, and of course the final write-up. I expect
the final product to be similar to an academic paper in terms of the
quality of figures, tables, and general formatting.</p>
<p>Please organize your folders in a useful way. The way I organize
things (though certainly not the only way to do it) is to keep a folder
for each new project and named accordingly. I typically have the
following subfolders:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Data</em>: This is where I keep the raw data files and any
additional data files I create as part of my analysis. I also keep a
“Research Data” folder on my computer that has raw data that I access
regularly, in which case the “Data” folder in any given project includes
symbolic links to the original raw data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Data Code</em>: This is where I keep the code for data
management (merging, clean-up, wrangling, etc.). Final analytic datasets
created by this code go to the “Data” subdirectory.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Analysis</em>: This is where I keep my analysis code files
and log files (if relevant).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Results</em>: Output from the analysis code files. I tend to
separate this into two subfolders - one for tables and one for
figures.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Papers</em>: If I’m writing the paper in
<code>R Markdown</code>, this is where I keep all of the markdown files.
With most co-authored work, though, we write in Overleaf. In that case,
I’ll still download different versions of the paper into this folder
when necessary (e.g., for different journal submissions)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Presentation</em>: This is where I keep my slides and
underlying code files.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s good to start developing some organization practices that work
best for you. It’s extremely easy to forget what you were doing on a
project once you have several things going at once, especially when you
wait for 6-8 months after submitting a paper for publication. The last
thing you want is to not be able to replicate your own work!</p>
</div>
<div id="presentations" class="section level2">
<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>You will present three papers throughout the course of the semester.
Any paper listed as “Primary Reading” in the class schedule can be
selected for presentation, with the exception of papers indicated by **
. Please inform me of your selected papers no later than <strong>Friday,
September 2</strong>. Please also note your papers and class dates on
the Google Sheet <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d6IVg-khbreLKobiczNwEOT9gjPNNykrFEtc2rXdJ4I/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>Each presentation should be no more than 30 minutes, including
questions and brief discussion. The presentation should follow a
standard conference setup, with a brief introduction/motivation, a very
brief discussion of the literature and some context of the paper,
discussion of the data, empirical analysis, and results.</p>
<p>Note that a presentation is not just a re-hashing of the paper in
slide form. A good academic presentation should have as little
information as possible on each slide, and the content on the slides
doesn’t necessarily need to follow that of the paper. For example, in a
real-time environment, it is much easier to move between different
aspects of the empirical analysis and data.</p>
<p>In addition to the presentation, please send me your slides in
advance. For people in the economics department, I expect the slides to
be completed in Beamer (LaTeX), <code>R Markdown</code>, or Python.
Others can use PowerPoint or some other presentation tool as they see
fit. My only recommendation with those other programs is that, for some
of them like Prezi or Powtoon, it is easy for the presentation to become
distracting. Slides should complement your presentation and not replace
your presence!</p>
<p>Grades for each presentation will be based 50% on the slides and 50%
on the actual presentation (delivery, clarity/organization, and
content). Additional details and a grading rubric are available on the
assignments page of our class website.</p>
</div>
<div id="literature-review-2nd-year-students" class="section level2">
<h2>Literature review (2nd year students)</h2>
<p>The literature review can be on any health economics topic of your
choice, subject to my approval. There is no specific page requirement.
10 double-spaced pages might be a good target, but an
efficiently-written paper could be shorter, while a student wishing to
use the paper as a springboard to a dissertation may choose to write
more. The paper will mostly consist of discussions of prior research,
but should end with discussions of three open questions in the
literature plus a proposed strategy for answering at least one of these
questions. The paper is due by <strong>Friday, November 18</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="draft-paper-3rd-year-students" class="section level2">
<h2>Draft paper (3rd year students)</h2>
<p>The paper requirement is more extensive for 3rd year students. In
this case, your papers should include not only an extensive literature
review but also a preliminary empirical analysis, including a discussion
of the data you’re using, the construction of your sample, your
identification strategy, econometric model and estimator, and some
preliminary results. There is again no specific page requirement, but I
expect at least 20 double-spaced pages to appropriately discuss your
topic, context, data, and early results. Your draft paper should end
with an outline of additional analyses you hope to run (i.e.,
robustness/sensitivity analyses, a discussion of different mechanisms of
interest, policy-relevant heterogeneities in your estimated effects,
etc.). The paper is due by <strong>Friday, November 18</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="due-dates" class="section level2">
<h2>Due dates</h2>
<p>This section is just to highlight the most important dates on which
an assignment is due. These dates are repeated within the description of
each assignment above. Note that you can always turn assignments in
prior to the official due date. Late assignments will receive an
automatic 10% reduction in the grade for each day the assignment is
turned in after the due date.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>September 2</strong>: Note the papers you plan to present on
the Google Sheet <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d6IVg-khbreLKobiczNwEOT9gjPNNykrFEtc2rXdJ4I/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
Only one student can present each paper, so this is first-come
first-served.</li>
<li><strong>Friday, November 18</strong>: Due date for literature review
or draft paper.</li>
<li>Empirical exercises due one week after the end of each module</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="final-grades" class="section level2">
<h2>Final grades</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>10%</strong> for participation (out of 25 possible
points)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>40%</strong> for empirical exercises (10% each)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>30%</strong> for presentations of selected papers (10%
each)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>20%</strong> for literature review (2nd year students) or
draft paper (3rd year students)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Letter grades will be assigned at the end of the course based on
total score achieved: (A = 100-93%, A- = 92.99-90%, B+ = 89.99-87%, B =
86.99-83%, B- = 82.99-80%, C+ = 79.99-77%, C = 76.99-73%, C- =
72.99-70%, D+ = 69.99-67%, D = 66.99-60%, F = 60% or less)</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="class-schedule" class="section level1">
<h1>Class Schedule</h1>
<p>Below is a preliminary outline of specific topics and readings
throughout the semester. Based on our collective interests, discussions,
and timing, individual papers and order may change somewhat, but any
such changes will be announced in advance. For each class, one of us
will present the “primary reading” papers, followed by a general
discussion of the papers and topic among the class. Papers listed as
“supplemental” represent other relevant papers in that area that we
won’t have time to cover directly in class. Classes listed with **
denote “lecture” days. I’ll handle presentations and manage any in-class
activities on those days.</p>
<p>Note that we have two scheduled virtual classes, one for Monday,
9/19, and another for Wednesday, 11/23. We also need to reschedule our
class for Monday, 11/21. I’ve tentatively rescheduled that for Friday,
December 2.</p>
