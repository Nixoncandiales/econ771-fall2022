# Overview
In this assignment, we're going to work through some applied issues related to instrumental variables. For a long time, IV (or 2SLS) was the primary identification strategy for applied empirical micro, but it fell out of favor as people became more aware of the assumptions underlying the estimator and better understand what IV actually estimates (not the ATE in most cases). People also started to find other strategies that were more compelling in some applications (and of course with some other assumptions).

Please "submit" your answers as a GitHub repository link. In this repo, please include a final document with your main answers and analyses in a PDF. Be sure to include in your repository all of your supporting code files. Practice writing good code and showing me only what I would need to recreate your results.


# Resources and data
The data for this assignment comes from three sources:


# Questions
In your GitHub repository, please be sure to clearly address/answer the following questions.

1. Provide and discuss a table of simple summary statistics showing the mean, standard deviation, min, and max of total physician-level Medicare spending, claims, and patients.

2. Plot the mean physician effort for integrated versus non-integrated physicians over time.

3. Using the medicare payment policy shock, estimate the effects of integration on physician effort. Present the first stage and reduced form results.

4. Specification and robustness checks

5. Recentering and shift-share
